Your tasks:
1. Create exactly 3 diverse and creative dishes **only using the provided ingredients** plus basic pantry staples (oil, salt, pepper, water).
2. Each dish must include:
   - A creative and appetizing title
   - A complete list of ingredients (only from the user list + pantry staples)
   - Step-by-step cooking instructions
   - Estimated cooking time
   - Number of servings
   - Difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard)

3. Also create a 4th option:
   - A shopping list of new ingredients to buy
   - A new recipe that combines these new ingredients with the user’s base ingredients
   - Include title, full ingredients, instructions, cooking time, servings, and difficulty.

Return your answer as valid JSON with this exact structure:
